A lightweight, scalable **SOCKS5 server** written in Rust (RFC 1928 + RFC 1929),
with a live terminal dashboard and a headless mode for containers. The protocol
is hand-written; the dependency footprint is kept deliberately small.

## Features

- **SOCKS5 commands** — `CONNECT` and `UDP ASSOCIATE` (RFC 1928). `BIND` is
  rejected with reply code `0x07` by design.
- **Authentication** — No-Auth (`0x00`) and Username/Password (`0x02`, RFC 1929).
  GSSAPI (`0x01`) is not implemented (a deliberate deviation from RFC 1928 §3,
  shared by virtually all deployed implementations); see
  [`docs/research/rfc-1928-1929-compliance.md`](docs/research/rfc-1928-1929-compliance.md)
  for the full compliance audit.
- **Address types** — IPv4, IPv6, and Domain (`ATYP` `0x01` / `0x04` / `0x03`),
  with server-side DNS resolution for both CONNECT and UDP targets.
- **Full RFC error mapping** — every reply code `0x00`–`0x08` is produced where
  applicable (e.g. unknown command → `0x07`, unknown address type → `0x08`,
  connection limit → `0x02`, refused/unreachable/timeout mapped from the OS).
- **UDP relay** — SOCKS5 encapsulation, `FRAG != 0` dropped, source-IP
  filtering, a client-reachable `BND.ADDR` (never `0.0.0.0`), and idle reclaim.
- **TUI dashboard** — real-time throughput with a trend chart, a sortable
  active-connection table, success/error stats, and a scrollable log with
  keyboard navigation (built on ratatui). A hidden `--mock` flag streams
  synthetic data for previewing/testing the UI without real traffic.
- **Headless mode** — `--no-tui` streams events to stdout, ideal for systemd /
  containers. The TUI is an optional cargo feature, so headless builds drop the
  ratatui/crossterm dependencies entirely.
- **Robustness** — connect / TCP-idle / UDP-idle timeouts, optional
  `max_connections` limit, half-open-aware relay, and graceful shutdown.
- **Configuration** — TOML file with CLI overrides.
- **Small & portable** — pure Rust, no C dependencies; ships as fully static
  musl binaries and a ~3.5 MB `scratch`-based container image.

## Installation

### Option 1 — One-line installer (recommended)

The installer picks **binary** or **docker**, generates credentials and a free
port automatically, and starts the service.

```bash
# Binary install, auth enabled with auto-generated user/password, random port:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZingerLittleBee/next-socks5/main/install.sh | sh

# With options (note the `-s --` to pass args through curl | sh):
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZingerLittleBee/next-socks5/main/install.sh \
  | sh -s -- --port 1080
```

Or clone and run locally. Each example is annotated below; in auth mode with no
`--user` / `--pass`, the installer generates a username and a 20-character
password and prints them at the end, together with a ready-to-use `socks5://`
URL and a `curl` test command.

```bash
# Show every flag and exit
./install.sh --help

# Simplest run: binary install, auth ON (auto-generated user/password), random free port
./install.sh

# Docker instead of a native binary (host networking, so UDP ASSOCIATE works)
./install.sh --method docker

# Open proxy (no auth) on a fixed port — only on a trusted network
./install.sh --method binary --no-auth --port 1080

# Explicit credentials on a fixed port
./install.sh --method docker --auth --user alice --pass secret --port 1080

# Bind to a single interface instead of 0.0.0.0 (here: localhost only)
./install.sh --no-auth --listen 127.0.0.1 --port 1080

# UDP relay behind NAT/Docker: pin the relay port range and advertise a DDNS name
./install.sh --port 1080 --udp-port-range 40000-40100 --udp-advertise socks.example.com

# Pin a specific release instead of `latest`
./install.sh --version v0.2.0 --port 1080

# Install the binary + config only — do NOT create or start a service
./install.sh --no-service --port 1080            # same as: NO_SERVICE=1 ./install.sh --port 1080

# Custom location: binary install dir (binary) / compose deploy dir (docker)
./install.sh --bin-dir /opt/bin --port 1080
./install.sh --method docker --dir ./ns5 --port 1080
```

| Flag | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--method <binary\|docker>` | Native binary (systemd/OpenRC) or Docker Compose | `binary` |
| `--auth` / `--no-auth` | Enable username/password auth, or run open | `--auth` |
| `--user` / `--pass` | Credentials for auth mode (random if omitted) | random |
| `--port <port>` | Listen port (random free port if omitted) | random |
| `--listen <addr>` | Bind address | `0.0.0.0` |
| `--udp-port-range <range>` | Bind UDP relay sockets inside an inclusive range (e.g. `40000-40100`) | OS ephemeral |
| `--udp-advertise <host>` | Advertised BND IP or DDNS name for UDP behind NAT/Docker | bound IP |
| `--version <tag>` | Release version, e.g. `v0.1.0` | `latest` |
| `--bin-dir <dir>` | Binary install directory (binary method) | `/usr/local/bin` |
| `--dir <dir>` | Docker deploy directory (docker method) | `./next-socks5-deploy` |
| `--no-service` | Install binary + config only; don't set up/start a service | off |

> Binary install targets Linux (musl x86_64 / aarch64) and sets up a **systemd**
> or **OpenRC** service. If neither init system is present, the binary and config
> are installed but **not started** (and won't auto-start on reboot) — start it
> manually or use `--method docker` for a self-restarting container. The
> installer is POSIX `sh` (no bash required).

### Option 2 — Docker

Fastest — let the installer generate `docker-compose.yml` + `config.toml` and
start the container for you (host networking; with `--auth` and no `--user` /
`--pass`, credentials are auto-generated and printed at the end):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZingerLittleBee/next-socks5/main/install.sh \
  | sh -s -- --method docker --auth --port 1080
```

This writes both files into `./next-socks5-deploy/` (override with `--dir`) and
runs `docker compose up -d`. To wire it up manually instead:

```bash
# No-auth, host networking (UDP ASSOCIATE works), listening on 1080:
docker run -d --name next-socks5 --network host \
  ghcr.io/zingerlittlebee/next-socks5:latest --listen 0.0.0.0:1080
```

With a config file (for auth):

```bash
docker run -d --name next-socks5 --network host \
  -v "$PWD/config.toml:/etc/next-socks5/config.toml:ro" \
  ghcr.io/zingerlittlebee/next-socks5:latest --config /etc/next-socks5/config.toml
```

Or with Compose (`docker-compose.yml`):

```yaml
services:
  next-socks5:
    image: ghcr.io/zingerlittlebee/next-socks5:latest
    container_name: next-socks5
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - ./config.toml:/etc/next-socks5/config.toml:ro
    # Writable runtime dir for the admin/attach socket — the image runs as an
    # unprivileged user that can't create /run/next-socks5 on its own. Without
    # this, `docker exec ... next-socks5 attach` cannot connect.
    tmpfs:
      - /run/next-socks5
    command: ["--config", "/etc/next-socks5/config.toml"]
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Images are multi-arch (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) and tagged with both the
release version (e.g. `0.1.0`) and `latest`. The container always runs headless.

### Option 3 — Prebuilt binaries

Download a static musl build from the
[Releases](https://github.com/ZingerLittleBee/next-socks5/releases) page:

```bash
curl -fL -o next-socks5.tar.gz \
  https://github.com/ZingerLittleBee/next-socks5/releases/latest/download/next-socks5-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz
tar xzf next-socks5.tar.gz
./next-socks5-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/next-socks5 serve --no-tui --listen 0.0.0.0:1080
```

(Replace `x86_64` with `aarch64` for ARM64.)

### Option 4 — Build from source

Requires a recent stable Rust toolchain.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZingerLittleBee/next-socks5
cd next-socks5
cargo build --release
./target/release/next-socks5 serve            # TUI dashboard
./target/release/next-socks5 serve --no-tui   # headless

# Headless-only build (drops the TUI deps):
cargo build --release --no-default-features
```

Or install straight from git:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/ZingerLittleBee/next-socks5
```

## Configuration

Configuration is a TOML file (see [`config.example.toml`](config.example.toml));
CLI flags override file values.

```toml
listen = "0.0.0.0:1080"

[auth]
method = "password"        # "none" | "password"
# One or more credentials — add a [[auth.users]] block per user.
[[auth.users]]
username = "alice"
password = "secret"

[[auth.users]]
username = "bob"
password = "hunter2"

[timeouts]
handshake_ms = 10000       # greeting+auth+request deadline (anti-slowloris)
connect_ms = 10000
tcp_idle_ms = 300000
udp_idle_ms = 60000

[limits]
max_connections = 2048     # optional: global concurrent cap (unbounded if unset)
max_per_ip = 64            # optional: per-source-IP concurrent cap (unbounded if unset)

[admin]
enabled = true             # local attach endpoint (default on)
# socket = "/run/next-socks5/admin.sock"   # override the socket path
```

**Multiple users.** With `method = "password"`, add a `[[auth.users]]` block per
credential — a client is accepted if its username/password matches **any** entry
in the list (RFC 1929). This is the recommended way to serve several users from a
single port; you do not need a separate port per user. With `method = "none"` the
proxy is open and the `users` list is ignored. (The dashboard logs each auth
attempt as `auth ok/failed for '<user>'`; per-user traffic accounting is not yet
shown in the connections table.)

**Connection limits.** Both caps under `[limits]` are **optional and unbounded by
default**; the server enforces them at accept time, so half-open/handshaking
connections count too. They are not set automatically — opt in via the config:

- `max_connections` — global cap on concurrent connections; a backstop against
  file-descriptor / task exhaustion. Size it to your host (the OS `RLIMIT_NOFILE`
  is the ultimate ceiling; each CONNECT relay uses ~2 fds).
- `max_per_ip` — concurrent connections from a single source IP. Stops one client
  from monopolizing the proxy or brute-forcing credentials at high concurrency. A
  generous value (e.g. 64–256) does not affect normal clients; lower it only if you
  do not expect many users behind a single NAT.

For an **internet-facing** deployment, set both. The proxy has no built-in auth
rate-limiting, so also front the listen port with a host firewall / fail2ban when
it is publicly exposed.

**Secure defaults.** Egress filtering is **on by default**: the proxy refuses to
relay to loopback, link-local (including the `169.254.169.254` cloud-metadata
address), and private/RFC1918 ranges (an SSRF / open-relay guard). If you genuinely
need to reach internal targets, relax it with an `[egress]` section — see
[`config.example.toml`](config.example.toml). The pre-relay handshake is bounded by
`timeouts.handshake_ms` (default 10s) to drop slowloris-style stalled clients.

### UDP relay & NAT / Docker

`CONNECT` works over the single TCP listen port, but **UDP ASSOCIATE** uses a
separate UDP relay socket. By default each association binds an OS-assigned
ephemeral UDP port and the server advertises a `BND.ADDR:BND.PORT` that the client
**must** send its datagrams to (RFC 1928). Two `[udp]` options make this work
through firewalls and NAT:

```toml
[udp]
port_range = "40000-40100"   # bind UDP relay sockets to this inclusive range
advertise  = "socks.example.com"  # client-reachable public IP or DDNS name
```

> `install.sh --udp-port-range 40000-40100 --udp-advertise socks.example.com` writes
> exactly this `[udp]` block for you.

- **`port_range`** — bind each association's UDP socket inside a known range
  instead of a random ephemeral port, so a firewall/NAT only needs that range
  opened. Each association binds its own socket, so size the range **≥ your
  expected concurrent UDP clients**; `"40000-40000"` is a single port and
  serializes UDP. When the range is exhausted, UDP ASSOCIATE returns a general
  failure.
- **`advertise`** — the client-reachable IP or DNS name used for the UDP
  ASSOCIATE reply. By default the server
  advertises the server-side IP the client's TCP connection arrived on (the
  control socket's local address); override it when that
  IP is not client-reachable (behind NAT, or Docker bridge networking). The
  advertised **port is always the real bound port**, so any NAT/forward must be
  **port-preserving (1:1)**. An unreachable advertised address is the #1 cause of
  "TCP works but UDP doesn't". A DNS name is resolved for each new association,
  and the resulting IP is returned to the client, so DDNS changes apply without
  restarting the server. Existing associations keep their original address.
  If resolution fails or yields no address matching the relay socket's address
  family, the association fails with `host unreachable` instead of advertising
  an unreachable private/bound address.
  Accepts a bare IP, `ip:port` (port ignored), or an ASCII DNS name; malformed
  values are rejected at startup.

**Docker.** The provided compose uses `network_mode: host` (Linux), which needs no
port mapping. For bridge networking, publish the TCP control port and the UDP
range with **short syntax** (Compose long syntax has no range support) and set
`advertise` to the host's public IP or DDNS name:

```yaml
ports:
  - "1080:1080/tcp"
  - "40000-40100:40000-40100/udp"
```

Keep the range small with the default userland proxy (Docker spawns one
`docker-proxy` process per published port); for large ranges set
`userland-proxy=false` or use host networking.

**Firewall** (range `40000-40100/udp` + control `1080/tcp`):

```bash
# ufw
ufw allow 1080/tcp && ufw allow 40000:40100/udp
# nftables
nft add rule inet filter input udp dport 40000-40100 accept
# iptables
iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 40000:40100 -j ACCEPT
```

**Port-remapping (PAT / symmetric) NAT** cannot work with a multi-port range (the
advertised internal port is wrong after translation). Use a single fixed port
(`"40000-40000"`) with a 1:1 forward of that one port, or host on a directly
reachable public IP.

### CLI

```
next-socks5                        Print help (a bare invocation never starts a server)
next-socks5 serve [OPTIONS]        Run the server (alias: run)
next-socks5 attach [OPTIONS]       Attach to a running server's dashboard

Server options:
  --config <path>       Path to a TOML config file
  --listen <addr>       Override the listen address (e.g. 0.0.0.0:1080)
  --no-tui              Run headless (events to stdout) instead of the dashboard
  --no-admin            Disable the local admin/attach endpoint
  --admin-socket <path> Override the admin socket path
  -h, --help            Print help

attach options:
  --socket <path>       Admin socket to connect to
                        (default /run/next-socks5/admin.sock)
```

## Usage

```bash
# Test a no-auth proxy:
curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:1080 https://example.com

# Test a password-authenticated proxy:
curl --socks5 alice:secret@127.0.0.1:1080 https://example.com
```

### Dashboard (TUI)

The terminal dashboard is on by default — just run the server without
`--no-tui`:

```bash
next-socks5 serve --listen 127.0.0.1:1080
```

It shows live throughput (with a 30s trend chart), success/error stats, a
sortable **Active connections** table, and a scrolling **Log**. Keys:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Tab` | Move scroll focus between the connections table and the log (focused panel is highlighted) |
| `s` | Cycle the connection sort key: `ID` → `UP↓` → `DOWN↓` → `AGE↓` (shown in the table title) |
| `↑` / `↓` or `k` / `j` | Scroll the focused panel one line |
| `PgUp` / `PgDn` | Scroll the focused panel one screen |
| `q` / `Ctrl-C` | Quit |

#### Preview / test the dashboard with synthetic data

To exercise the dashboard without sending any real traffic, add `--mock`. It
drives the same metrics and event bus the proxy uses with a stream of synthetic
connections, throughput, and errors — handy for trying the sorting/scrolling
keys or taking screenshots. The fake activity stops as soon as you quit.

```bash
# Local preview: open the dashboard and continuously generate mock data.
cargo run --release -- serve --listen 127.0.0.1:1080 --mock

# Or with an installed binary:
next-socks5 serve --listen 127.0.0.1:1080 --mock
```

`--mock` is a demo/testing aid only; never enable it on a real proxy.

### Attach to a running service

A service installed via systemd / OpenRC / Docker runs **headless** (no UI of
its own), but it still serves the live dashboard over a local Unix socket
(default `/run/next-socks5/admin.sock`). To watch a server that is **already
running**, attach to it from the same machine — there is nothing to restart and
no flag to enable; the endpoint is on by default.

```bash
# 1. SSH into the host where the service runs (as root for the default socket):
ssh root@your-server

# 2. Attach — default socket /run/next-socks5/admin.sock:
next-socks5 attach

# Docker: run attach inside the container instead:
docker exec -it next-socks5 next-socks5 attach
```

If the service uses a non-default socket path (e.g. a manual install on a custom
path), point `--socket` at it:

```bash
next-socks5 attach --socket /tmp/ns5.sock
```

The endpoint is local-only (no network exposure, no auth) and read-only — attach
clients observe but cannot control the server. Press `q` to detach; if the
server stops, the dashboard exits with `connection lost`.

> The default socket lives under `/run/next-socks5` (mode `0710`, owned by the
> service user). `root` can always attach; a non-root user can only attach to a
> socket it owns (e.g. a manual install under `/tmp` or `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`).
>
> **Docker:** the container runs as an unprivileged user (uid `65534`) and needs a
> writable `/run/next-socks5` for the admin socket. The installer's generated
> Compose (and the example above) provide it via `tmpfs`; a bare `docker run`
> needs `--tmpfs /run/next-socks5`. Without it the server logs
> `admin endpoint disabled: Permission denied` and `attach` cannot connect.

Disable the endpoint with `--no-admin` or `[admin] enabled = false`.

For a manual install (`--no-service`), the process runs as your user and the
default `/run` path is usually not writable. Start the server with a writable
socket and attach to the same path:

```bash
next-socks5 serve --no-tui --admin-socket /tmp/ns5.sock
next-socks5 attach --socket /tmp/ns5.sock
```

## Performance

On a single 4-core cloud VM (loopback), next-socks5 relays at **~2 GB/s** with
**~1.6 ms** of added per-request latency and **~6k new connections/s**, and
profiling shows the proxy is kernel/network-bound with no lock contention — i.e.
the proxy itself is not the bottleneck. See
[`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) for the methodology, the reproducible
harness ([`tests/scripts/`](tests/scripts/)), and full numbers.
